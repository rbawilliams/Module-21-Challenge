# KaseiCoin Project

 ![alt=""](application-image.png)

## Background
After being selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency, you have been tasked with developing a monetary system for the first human colony on Mars. You have decided to create a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin (Kasei means Mars in Japanese). To fund the project, you will launch a crowdsale, allowing people who are moving to Mars to convert their Earthling money to KaseiCoin.

## What You're Creating
In this project, you will create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant, named KaseiCoin. Additionally, you will develop a crowdsale contract that manages the entire crowdsale process, enabling users to send Ether and receive KaseiCoin tokens in return. The contract will automatically mint and distribute tokens to buyers in a single transaction. Optionally, you can extend the crowdsale contract using OpenZeppelin.

## Files
You can find the starter code and instructions for this project in the following files:

KaseiCoin.sol: Starter code for the KaseiCoin token contract.
KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol: Starter code for the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract.

## Instructions
Follow these steps to complete the project:

Create the KaseiCoin token contract.
Create the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract.
Create the KaseiCoin deployer contract.
Deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain.
Refer to the detailed instructions provided in the project files for each step.

## Evaluation Evidence
Please refer to the screenshots directory in the repository for the evidence of successful compilation and deployment. The screenshots include the compilation success for the KaseiCoin token contract, KaseiCoin crowdsale contract, and KaseiCoin deployer contract, along with the transaction details and contract addresses during deployment.
